# Coding Projects
### IST555 - State Modeling
- **Description:** Developed a state modeling python framework that would review potential impacts to supply chain based on supply and demand.

- **Key Features:**
  * Dynamically generated Wiki using Sphnix.
  * Global classes to create re-usability on a variance of parameters and inputs.
  * Written exclusively in Python and deployed using Github Actions.
  * Yaml input files to control overall inputs into mutable variables

# Architecture Diagrams
### Network Security Architecture
- **Description:** Presented a comprehensive network security architecture incorporating firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and secure network segmentation.

- **Notable Elements:**
  * Implementation of VPNs for secure remote access.
  * Setup of VLANs for multisite connectivity
  * Overall full network design of an enterprise with remote locations

### Serverless Security Architecture
- **Description:**  An AWS based microservice application that is designed to do event driven management and remediation on potential security events.
- **Notable Elements:**
  * Immediate evaluation of events in real time
  * Ability to include an exceptions table to avoid issues with applications approved for certain configurations
  * Fully fed into dynamodb and then pressed to Athena, allowing for easy querying on events

### Packer Golden Image AMI Architecture
- **Description:**  An AWS based microservice application that is designed to create, test and bootstrap a hardened ami image to be used across multiple cloud environemnts.  
- **Notable Elements:**
  * Complete tracking of security fixes and their related Benchmark
  * Cloud Agnostic - Can run the same security bootstrapping regardless of public cloud provider
  * Full end-to-end testing and tracking prior to deployment to the organization.
